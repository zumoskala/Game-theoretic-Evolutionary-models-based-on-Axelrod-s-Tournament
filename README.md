The Hawk-Dove Game is an example of game theory used in modelling animal behavior. In this model, we have two animals capable of choosing from two strategies when in conflict with one another. The animal can choose to be a "hawk" and escalate to a fight or the animal can choose to be a "dove" and peacefully back down.  The game is similar to Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, but it is always assumed that the value of the resource is less than the cost of a fight. In this project, we aim to discover the most efficient strategy for the Hawk-Dove Game. We also want to check if we can evolve an agent, that performs better than agents with basic strategies.   

This study proposes the following hypothesis: 
Strategy evolved from evolutionary algorithm performs better than other strategies in iterated Hawk-Dove Game.
